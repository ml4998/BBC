<h1>Analyzing Global Representation in BBC's "Greatest" Directors List</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, I employed web scraping tools like Beautiful Soup and Playwright, alongside regular expressions, to mine data from the BBC's website. This approach enabled me to compile detailed CSV files containing movie directors, film titles, and critics' reviews. Furthermore, by utilizing Playwright, I extracted additional details from each director’s IMDb page, such as their nationalities and personal page links, enriching my database significantly. The culmination of this data collection was a visual map showcasing the distribution of directors by country, highlighting their names and nationalities.</p>

<h2>Insights and Analysis</h2>
<p>The analysis revealed a potential bias in the BBC's selection of “the greatest” directors, with a predominance of figures from Western countries. This discovery poses pressing questions about diversity and representation in the film industry: Are Western countries producing more films, or are films from non-Western countries underrepresented and less marketed? These findings open a critical dialogue on the need for broader inclusivity in recognizing cinematic talents globally.</p>

<h2>Future Directions and Journalistic Implications</h2>
<p>From a journalistic perspective, further reporting is essential. I plan to gather historical data and scrape box office information for each film to analyze their profitability and market reach. Engaging with artists and cinema experts will also provide insights into emerging trends and whether other nations are poised to challenge the cinematic dominance of the United States. This expanded investigation will aim to uncover deeper narratives about global cinematic landscapes and the evolving dynamics of film production and recognition.</p>
